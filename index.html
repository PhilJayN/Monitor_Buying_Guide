    <h2>Intended Audience</h2>
    <p>This guide is intended for beginners who are
      overwhelmed with the plethora of choices, buzzwords, and acronyms of the monitor market.
      The aim of the guide is to narrow down the buying process by breaking it into manageable chunks.
      Because of this, there will not be in depth scientific explanation of all the different acronyms,
      such as TN, IPS, VA, LCD, etc. All of that is enough to make anyone's head spin.
      Instead, the guide will present the audience with just enough information, so
      that they can make their own decision based on their needs. After being exposed to the general landscape of
      the monitor market, the reader can be more confident
     to do their own research on particular topics that interest them.</p>

    <p>This guide is for you if you fit any of the following:</p>
    <ul class="primary-content-ul">
      <li><span>You're new to the monitor market, or have never purchased a monitor by yourself. </span></li>
      <!-- <li><span>You have not purchase a monitor in years and need a refresher.</span></li> -->
      <li><span>You're overwhelmed with the plethora of monitor choices and terminologies.</span></li>
      <!-- <li><span>You have a budget in mind, and/or want to buy a monitor with the "best bang for your buck".
        Have extra money to splurge, and want the top of the line, jammed packed with features? There's a separate page for that here. </span></li> -->
      <li><span>You like doing some additional research before making a final purchase.</span></li>
      <li><span>You don't really care about the scientific concepts of TN, IPS, VA panels, but just
        want to know which one is best suited for you.</span></li>
      <li><span>You ready to buy a monitor but a still hesistant and need a checklist before making a final purchase.</span></li>

    <h5>Why I Wrote this Guide</h5>
    <p>I don't want people to make the same headache inducing and time wasting mistakes
      as I did with my monitor experiences. When I was younger,
      I needed a monitor, but I didn't have a clue what to pick. I went to a local store, looked around for
      a few minutes, and made my first purchase based on whatever looked good at the moment.
      That experience turned out to be a time wasting mistake.</p>
    <p>For my next purchase, I decided to research on the Internet about monitors. Hours later, all
      I got was a migrane. The information was
    scattered all over, and I didn't have the slightest clue on what keywords to look for.</p>
    <p>I was  very frustrated. I just wanted a monitor! When I
      finally found a good guide, it was still lacking: It discussed interesting monitor features, but it
    didn't say why that feature would benefit me.</p>
      <p>I don't want other people to go through the frustration I went through.
      This guide is full of my experiences that's designed to help save you time.</p>
     <p>When you buy the right monitor for you, your eyes, your heart (too corny?), and your wallet will thank you!
      It's a purchase
      you'll keep for a long time, so make sure you're truly happy with it.
     </p>
    <p>Ready to find your monitor? Lets go!</p>

      <h4>Legend</h4>
      <p>Throughout the guide, you'll see little icons scattered throughout the text.
      Feel free to ignore most of these. However, pay attention to any exclamation 'warning'
      icons you see because they can help you
      save you time and headache.</p>

    <h2>Wishlist and Criteria Tool</h2>
    <p>The wishlist and criteria is designed to help you keep track of the various
    monitor criteria and features that you might want as you read through the guide. It's
    recommended that you use it because you'll find that the monitor market has a dizzying
    amount of terms and acronyms. </p>

    <p>How the tool is useful:</p>
    <ul class="primary-content-ul">
      <li><span> You can save/print/take it with you while you shop at a physical store,
        to have a more productive shoppping trip because you'll know exactly what you want.
      </span></li>
      <li><span>When there is a limited time sale online, you can quickly double check to see
         that the sale item
      has all the features you need so you can purchase right away.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>There's a button below to hide it should you find it obtrusive. </p>

</section>


  <section class="contents-section" id="section-primary-use">
  <h2>Primary Use</h2>
  <p>How much time you spend on a certain task or activity on your computer ultimately determines the kind
  of monitor you should get. There are monitors for gamers, graphic designers,
    programmers and analysts, etc... It's important to purchase a
    monitor based on <em>your</em> needs, not
  on what others says, and definitely not on what companies advertise.</p>

  <!-- <p class="side-warning"> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"><span> Warning!</span></i>
    The choice you pick here will determine what options and/or dicussion will show up or not show up after this section.
    For example, if you choose your
    primary use to be productivity and you never, or rarely ever play video games, then
    the main section discussing monitors for gaming will not be discusssed.
  </p> -->

  <div class="button-group">
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-default button-group__btn"><i class="fa fa-gamepad" aria-hidden="true"> Gaming</i></button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-default button-group__btn"><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"> Productivity and Work</i></button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-default button-group__btn"><i class="fa fa-desktop" aria-hidden="true"> Everything</i></button>

  </section>

  <!-- <section class="contents-section">
  <h2>Primary Use</h2>
  One can walk into an electronics store, close one's eyes, purchase a monitor, and be extremly happy, or extremely disssapointed.
  Therefore it's important to purchase a monitor based on <em>your</em> needs. There are monitors for gamers, graphic designers,
  programmers and analysts, and everyday use. Picking a monitor based on what you need it to do will generally result better results.
  <p>Warning: The choice you pick here will determine what options show up on the following page. For example, if you choose your
  primary use to be productivity and you never play a single game, then the monitor options for gaming will not be discusssed because, well,
  you won't need it. </p>
  </section> -->

  <section class="contents-section" id="section-price-range">
    <h2>Pick Price Range</h2>
    <p>It's good to have a budget and add an additional $30 - $100 to that budget. As you're shopping,
      you might come across a good monitor within your original budget, but it might be missing a few important features.
      If you allow yourself some 'leg room' in your budget, you don't have to compromise on a monitor you kind of don't like.
      A somewhat flexible budget allows you to still get what you love at the same time not have to compromise too much.
      A monitor is something many people will spend hours using, and
    many people keep the same monitor for years.<p>
    <p>
    Try not to divorce your monitor.
    Returning a monitor is not as easy as other items. It's heavy, bulky, and costly to ship. In addition, not too many stores
    are going to accept a monitor return with open arms.
    Do your best to pick and buy a monitor because you love it, not because you "kinda like it", or "it's okay". Don't settle, and think long term!

  <h2>Pick Aspect Ratio</h2>
  <p class="definitions"><i class="fa fa-book definition-icon" aria-hidden="true"><span> Defintion</span></i>
    Aspect ratio: Describes the proportional relationship of the image's width and height.
    A 1920 x 1080 monitor with an aspect ratio of 16:9 means that the monitor has
    more pixels at its width than it has pixels at its height.
   </p>

   <p>While monitor shoppping, you'll see numbers like 16:9, 16:10, 21:9, etc...
     Don't give yourself a headache thinking about this. Just
    decide what activity you'll primarily be doing on the monitor and pick based on that.
  </p>

  <p>16:9 aspect ratio is a great all rounder, jack of all trades. It is quite common
  in mainstream retail stores.</p>
  <p>Consider 16:9 if any of the following applies to you:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>You dislike black bars that ultrawides show on unsupported movies and games. </span></li>
    <li><span>You like watching more TV shows than movies, since many TV shows support 16:9</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>16:10 aspect is great for anyone, especially programmers, and analysts, who needs the extra vertical space. You'll scroll
  up and down less.</p>

    <p>Consider 21:9 ultrawides if any of the following applies to you:</p>
    <ul class="primary-content-ul">
      <li><span>You have some extra cash. (Ultrawides typically cost more)</span></li>
      <li><span>You've tried dual or triple monitor setup and are bothered by bezels of many monitors</span></li>
      <li><span>You're a programmer who likes to have command prompt, text editor, browser,
        etc... all opened at the same time.</span></li>
      <li><span>You like playing RPG or FPS games.</span></li>
      <li><span>You are a content or movie editor who uses Audacity, Adobe premiere (great for expanded timeline)</span></li>
      <li><span>You're constantly using Excel and are tired of side scrolling extra wide spreadsheets.</span></li>
      <li><span>You love watching movies in 21:9 because it's more immersive.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="side-warning"> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"><span> Warning!</span></i>
      Ultrawide is great but make that the particular game
      or movie actually supports it.</p>
    <!-- <p>21:9 ultrawide is great for the following, -->
    <!-- <ul class="primary-content-ul">
      <li><span>Watching movies</span></li>
      <li><span>Playing games</span></li>
      <li><span>Content creation, movie editing, programming, excel. You appreciate the

    <h2>Pick Screen Size</h2>
    <p>
    Screen size and pixel should be picked deliberately, not haphazardly.
    Even though size is a personal preference, some thought should go into it.
    You want screen size and resolution to mesh with each other nicely, like ketchup and french fries.
    </p>
    <p>A 23" monitor with 3840 x 2160 resolution is not a good match if you're reading
      lots of text, unless you have bird of prey vision. There's too many pixels on a screen that small. As a result,
      text would be
      too small and difficult to read. On the other hand, some people might consider text on a 32" monitor with a 1920 x 1080 resolution
      too big, bulky, and pixelated.
    </p>
    <!-- <p class="side-note"><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"><span> Side note</span></i>
      To get a frame of reference, 23" - 27" is the most common screen size.
      The sweet spot for monitor size, if you had only 2 seconds to pick, would be 27" at 2560 x 1440.
     </p> -->

     <p class="side-note"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"><span> Side note</span></i>
       23" - 27" is the most common screen size.
        The sweet spot for monitor size, if you had 2 seconds to pick, would be 27" at 2560 x 1440.
    </p>

    <h4>Screen Real Estate</h4>
    <p>Note that "screen real estate" refers to the amount of display space available
      for the user to work with. Generally, more screen real estate is preferable, especially
       for productivity. It allows the user to have more windows and applications opened
       at the same time, side by side. You could have a browser on the left, a Word document
       in the middle, and an Excel spreadsheet to the right. No more alt tabbing, resizing, and switching windows!
       For reference, a 27" monitor at 2560 x 1440 will provide more screen real estate than a 27" monitor at 1920 x 1080. </p>

  <h2>Pick a Resolution</h2>
  <p class="definitions"><i class="fa fa-book definition-icon" aria-hidden="true"><span> Defintion</span></i>
     Display resolution: The number of distinct pixels that a display device
     can have shown on it. It is described by width x height, with units measured in pixels.
     Example: 1920 pixels x 1080 pixels, or more commonly shown as 1920 x 1080, or sometimes just 1080p.
   </p>

  <p>If you ask 10 people their opinions on a resolution you should get for your monitor,
    you'll probably get 10 different answers. And here's why: Resolution
  deals greatly with personal preferences and special use case for the monitor.
 </p>
 <p>Some people prefer really sharp and crispy text, while others prefer
   bigger text. So to find the best resolution for <em>you</em>,
  first discover what you need to use the monitor for.</p>

  <p>Consider the following when picking a resolution:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Eyesight - If you have good eyesight, you can go for higher resolution
      as the text will be smaller but clearer and "crispier". </span></li>
    <!-- <li><span>Operating system (OS) - OS handles text scaling differently. MAC OS does not
      seem to have issues with high DPI as previous versions of windows. </span></li> -->
      <li><span>Distance from monitor - Having your eyes approximately 20 inches
        away from a monitor screen is a good distance,
      but if you sit closer or farther from a monitor, then pick a resolution accordingly.
      If you like sitting close, you can pick a higher resolution because the individual pixels won't be that noticable.
       If you like sitting
       far away, you can pick a lower resolution because you're probably too far away to see individual pixels.
       However, sitting 35 inches away while using a
       23" monitor at 3840 x 2160 is asking for trouble because the text will be too small.
     </span></li>
    <li><span>Primary use - If you work mainly with text, go for higher resolution.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: Different groups of people will answer monitor related resolution questions differently.
    If you ask gamers if you should buy a 27" 2560 x 1440 or a 32" 2560 x 1440, then
    you'll probalby get a different response than if you had asked a programmer or writer.
    The former usually won't care to much about resolution, but rather more about refresh rates. The latter
    will care more about resolution because they are reading text all day.
    But if you ask me—programmer and gamer who has eyesight a tad bit
    above average—then I'll
    tell you that 27" 2560 x 1440 is great for text <em>and</em> gaming, but 32" 2560 x 1440 is great gaming
    but not for text because there's not enough pixel on a screen size that's too already too big.
  </p>

  <p>Note: Remember that there will be outliers. You'll occasionally run across people who
  will say: "I sit 35 inches away from my 23" 3840 x 2160 monitor, and I can see everything just fine!"
  Listen to your own research and follow the general patterns of the average person, not outliers. These people
just have amazing hawk-like eye sight, or a special setup for their monitors. </p>

<p>Note: Windows does have a built in text scaling. So if you purchase a 3840 x 2160 and find that the
  text size is too small, there is option to change the size of the text. However, this also has some issues as well.
You'll usually get the best result if you pick the proper resolution in the first place and keep the scaling at the default value of 100%. </p>

  <p>A common question:</p>
  <p>If I go from a 24" 1920 x 1080 to a 27" 1920 x 1080 , is that an upgrade?
    For the most part, no. You are still working with the same number of pixels, just on a larger screen.
  Text won't be as crisp because the pixels are much larger on the 27".</p>

  <h2>Pick a Panel</h2>
  <!-- <div> -->
    <h4>IPS (In-Plane Switching)</h4>
    <p>You most likely have an IPS panel right next to you! Check your phone.
      It probably has an IPS panel. Phone screens need to look great, regardless of
      how the consumer hold or view it. This makes IPS panels popular for mobile devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      IPS panels can be described as "vibrant", "colorful", and/or "lively",
      with great viewing angles, and thus less color shift.
      To better demonstrate viewing angle and why its useful, take your phone screen and
      move its screen in different direction. You'll notice that the colors of the
      picture will change very little. This is a huge advantage of an IPS panel.
    </p>
    <p>Some consumer like IPS because
      it allows them to lay down on the ground or exercise on the floor while watching a
      movie. Others like IPS so they can share the same screen when working on a project. Both users
      will be able to see images and text with mostly the same color and clarity.
      Try doing this
      with TN panels, and you'll discover that the pictures will have a yellow-ish look, or be washed out.

        <h4>Panel Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Picking a panel is about compromise and knowing what you'll use the
        monitor for. Gamers will like TN panels for their faster response time and affordability. Also,
        gamers tend to play with the monitor in front of their face, so viewing angle isn't a big priority.
        However, there is nothing stopping a gamer from getting an IPS pannel with super high refresh rates,
        and quick response time, if they have the extra money.
        <p>Graphic designers will like VA for contrast or IPS for the awesome the viewing angles and vibrant colors.</p>
        Programmers will like IPS for its ability to look good even in portrait mode, especially because
        coding benefits greatly from a monitor in vertical portrait mode. TN does not look very nice in portrait mode.

  <h2>Pick Finish</h2>
  <p>For the most part, a monitor's screen being matte or glossy is a matter of personal preference.</p>
  <p>Matte monitor advantages:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Less annoyance due to less reflection</span></li>
    <li><span>Less eyestrain due to less light bouncing</span></li>
    <li><span>Untainted picture quality because outside objects aren't reflected into monitor</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Matte monitor disadvantages:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Inability see people's reflection sneaking behind you</span></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How to Tell If Monitor's Screen Is Glossy or Matte</h4>
  <p>If you are unable to tell through pictures while online, take a look at the product specifications, which will typically
   use the following keywords:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Anti-glare</span></li>
    <li><span>Anti-glare coating</span></li>
    <li><span>Matte finish, matte screen</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you are unable to find this information, consider looking at the monitor's manuals.
  Dell.com has an amazing search engine for their monitors. If you still cannot find the information, try going to Reddit's many
  subreddits, such as /r/monitors, /r/pcmasterrace, /r/ultrawidemasterrace and asking there.

Just make sure to do some
  research first and let people know that you've
tried looking for specs and manuals but couldn't find it. You'll increase your chances of getting help if you
make some sort of attempt to research first.</p>

<p class="side-note"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note"><span> Side note</span></i>
  There is a misconception that people have about IPS panels being "glossy", or "too shiny".
  This is wrong and likely comes from the fact that phones and tablet
  (which typically have IPS panels)
  are by nature very glossy, shiny, and reflective. So it's understandable that some people
  affiliate IPS with glossiness.
  The panel type has very little to do with
  how reflective or non-reflective a screen looks. Rather, it's just a matter of the type of coating a
  manufacturer decides to put on the monitor. So rejoice! You have can pick if you want your IPS to be glossy or matte!

  <h2>Pick Mounting Option and VESA Support</h2>
  <p>
  If you do not have plans on mounting your monitor on an extendable or flexible monitor arm,

   the built-in stand has any or all the following options:
  </p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Height adjust - For ergonomic reasons, you want to be able to adjust the monitor up and down.</span></li>

  </ul>
  <h4>VESA Mounting</h4>
  <p>If you're unsure whether you want to use the default stand or VESA mount in the future,
  then buy a monitor with VESA mounting option. You'll find yourself in a predicament should you want to
  use VESA mount in the future and your monitor lacks it. There are adapters

<section class="contents-section" id="section-xsync">
<h2>Pick X-Sync Tech</h2>
<h3>G-SYNC or FreeSync</h3>
<p> These two techs will add more cost to a monitor, with G-SYNC typically
   costing $100 - $200 more than AMD's FreeSync.</p>
<p>Nvidia's G-SYNC and AMD's FreeSync is another debate and discussion that could take a small book to explain.
   To keep it simple, keep in mind that G-SYNC and FreeSync will give gamers a "smooth, buttery feeling".
   Some would consider G-SYNC and FreeSync to be a luxury, while others consider
   these two technology a must have. But for all intents
   and purposes, for the average consumer, FreeSync, and especially G-SYNC will be a luxury item because it adds
   to the price of the monitor.
 </p>
 <p>It is important to note that if a user has never experienced G-SYNC for FreeSync, then
 the user will not miss out on anything. But the moment a user has experienced using these two techs
to play games, it is very difficult to play games without these techs. There's no going back once it's been used.</p>
<p>Remember, the choice that you make whether to go G-SYNC or FreeSync is permanent for
the lifespan of your monitor or your GPU. You will be effectively "locking" yourself into a company
by buying a technology. Let me elaborate: If you buy a monitor with Nvidia's G-SYNC, then all future GPU purchases
you make should be Nvidia, if you want to utilize G-SYNC. It's a little wasteful
to have a monitor that supports G-SYNC sitting there, not being used to its full potential. Of course, you could
always sell the monitor, or just use the monitor without using G-SYNC. Just something to think about!</p>

<p class="side-warning"> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"><span> Warning!</span></i>
   If you want to take advantage of a monitor's FreeSync feature, you need an AMD GPU.
   Similarily, if you want to take advantage of a monitor's G-SYNC feature, you'll need
  an NVIDIA GPU.

  <h2>Warranty and Customer Service</h2>
  <p>
    "Customer service is one of those things that you don't really need. But when
    you need it, you <em>really</em> need it."
  </p>

  <p> When buying monitor, consider both the seller and the manufacturer's reputation and customer service.
    Most monitors are usually defect free, with the exception
    of cases where the consumer will get monitors with ghosting, dead pixels,
    stuck pixels, etc... Because of this, it's important to consider how pain-free or pain-full
    a company's RMA (return) process is.  </p>

    <p>It's not a good feeling to be on the receiving end of bad luck with a poor
      quality monitor and have to deal with terrible customer service on the side.
    You'll end up talking to the bad seller, who will advise you to contact the manfucturer,
    who has a headache inducing customer service department who will
    make you ride a roller coaster to get your monitor fixed. At this point,
    you'll wish that you had spent the extra dollars and purchased from a reputable seller and manufacturer.
    <p>
      Also remember to consider each company's reputation and the number of warranty years they offer for their products. Typically, warranty varies from 1 year - 3 years. </p>

<section class="contents-section" id="section-refresh">
  <h2>Pick Refresh Rate</h2>
  <p>I'm going to keep it simple with refresh rates: Get a monitor with the highest refresh
  rate that you can afford <strong>and</strong> that your GPU can handle. Typically monitors with high
  refresh rates will cost more. </p>
  <p>The average mainstream monitor comes with a refresh rate of 60hz, so you can get up to 60fps while gaming depending on the game,
    as long as your GPU can push out those frames. If you decide to go for monitors with higher refresh rates,
make sure to do more research and look at benchmarks to be sure that your current GPU
can actually keep up with the high refresh rates. </p>
  <!-- <p>What happens if you decide to get a monitor with a high refresh rate of 144hz but your GPU
  is not powerful enough to push out more frames per second? Well, nothing bad happens,
  but you just won't be able to utilize all that high refresh rate goodness, until you upgrade your GPU.</p> -->
  <p>One thing to keep in mind is that if a user has never experienced higher refresh rates,
  they won't miss anything because there's no frame of reference to compare anything to.
   But if a user has been playing on a 144hz monitor for a while,
   and they have to go back to a 60hz monitor, they will feel the pain.
  Game play will not feel buttery smooth anymore. If you've never used it,
don't worry, you're not missing out. But if you use it, it's difficult to go back.</p>

  <p>Considering the following before finalizing your purchase, as they might save
  you some minor headaches:</p>

  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Make sure your GPU has the correct ports that the monitor needs: Display Port, HMDI, DVI, etc..</span></li>
    <li><span>If cable length is important to you, buy additional cables, as the default cables sometimes only 3 feet long</span></li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Pick Miscellaneous Features</h3>
  <p>Sometimes you'll see that certain monitors come with extra
    features, such as Blue light filter or built-in speakers. These features should not make or
  break your buying monitor decision because there are alternative solutions:
  If you want blue light filter, get a free program called Flux. If you want great sound, get dedicated speakers. </p>
  <p>Some people prefer built in speakers in a monitor, and that's absolutely fine! Although the sound quality
  won't be amazing, built-in speakers sound pretty decent and are great for people who don't need to blast bass
  at 1000% and who prefer a clean desk without bulky speaker and subwoofer setups.</p>
