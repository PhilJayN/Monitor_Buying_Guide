  <h2>Primary Use</h2>
  One can walk into an electronics store, close one's eyes, purchase a monitor, and be extremly happy, or extremely disssapointed.
  Therefore it's important to purchase a monitor based on <em>your</em> needs. There are monitors for gamers, graphic designers,
  programmers and analysts, and everyday use. Picking a monitor based on what you need it to do will generally result better results.

  <h2>Pick Price Range</h2>
  It's good to have a budget and add about $50 to $100 to that budget. A monitor is something you'll mostly likely spend 8 hours a day on. Furthermore,
  many people keep monitors for years. Typically a monitor will see about 2-10 years of its life with the same owner. Try not to divorce your monitor.
  Returning a monitor is not as easy: it's heavy, bulky, costly to ship, and many stores aren't going to accept a monitor return with open arms.
  So make sure you don't go too cheap on a monitor.

  <h2>Pick a Size</h2>
  Size is a personal preference, and frankly very subjective. But some thought should go into it. 23" - 27" is the most common. Remember! Screen size and pixel
  should be picked deliberately, not haphazardly. You want screen size and resolution to mesh with each other nicely, like ketchup and french fries.
  <p>Most people would agree that a 23" with 4k resolution is not a good match. There's too many pixels on a small screen size, so text would be too small and difficult to read.
  On the other hand, 32" with a 1920 x 1080 pixel would be very pixelated. Text by default will look too big, bulky, and pixelated. Interestly, some people
  are very happy because the bigger text will be easier to read.</p>

  <p>
    The sweet spot for monitor size, though, is 27" at 2560 x 1440.

  <h3>Screen Real Estate</h3>
  <p>Note that "screen real estate" refers to the amount of virtual space available for the user to work with,
    more space to have more windows and applications all opened all at the same time, side by side. A 27" monitor
    at 2560 x 1440 will provide more space to work with than a 27" monitor at 1920 x 1080. </p>

    <h4>For Programmers, Analysts, etc...</h4>
    Programmers, analysts, and any user who constantly have text editors and Excel spreadsheets opened will enjoy having more
  "screen real estate.

  <h3>Pick Eye Care Tech</h3>
  <p>Do you suffer from migrane, headaches, or eyestrain while using the computer?
  If so, then getting a monitor with flicker free technology will be beneficial.</p>
  <p>Typically, each company has their own names for this technology, but its function remains the same.
  Be on the lookout for naming:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Acer - Flicker-less</li>
    <li>Asus - Eye care</li>
    <li>LG - Flicker safe</li>
    <li>BenQ - ZeroFlicker or Flicker-free</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pick Mounting Option and Vesa Support</h3>
  If you do not have any plans on mounting your monitor on a stand, and would like to use the default stand
  that comes with the monitor, then there is no need to consider whether a monitor comes with Vesa mounts.
  If you're opting for the default monitor stand, consider the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Height adjust - For ergonomic reasons, you want to be able to adjust the monitor up and down as you please</li>
    <li>Pivot and tilt - A nice stand should offer these, if you decide you want
    movement freedom</li>
    <li>Landscape and portrait mode - Some people prefer to orient their monitors in
    a portrait position to allow them to have more vertical space.
     </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Vesa Mounting</h4>
  <p>If you're unsure whether you want to use the stand or Vesa mount in the future,
  then spend the extra money now to make sure you have Vesa mounting option, should you
  ever decide you want it. You'll find yourself in a predicament should you want to
  use Vesa mount in the future and your monitor lacks it. However, there adapters
  to use for monitors without Vesa mount holes, but a monitor with built in Vesa mount holes will
  give you less headaches.
</p>

<h3>Pick X-Sync Technology: G-sync or Freesync</h3>
<h4>Lets talk about $$$ upfront</h4>
<p> These two techs will add more cost to a monitor, with G-sync typically
   costing more ($100 - $200) than AMD's Freesync. If you have a budget, get Freesync. Note: If you want to utilize
 a monitor with Freesync, you need a AMD GPU. Similarily, if you want to utilize a monitor with G-sync, you'll need
an Nvidia GPU. </p>
<p>Nvidia's G-sync and AMD's Freesync is another debate and discussion that could takes hours or days,
and the differences and similarities between these two tech will takes pages of write-up. So to keep it simple,
just keep in mind that G-sync and Freesync will give gamers a "smooth, buttery feeling. Some would consider
G-sync and Freesync to be a luxury, while others consider these two technology a must have. But for all intents
and purposes, for the average consumer, G-sync and Freesync will be a luxury item because it adds
to the price of the monitor.
 </p>
 <p>It is important to note that if a user has never experienced G-sync for Freesync, then
 the user will not miss out on anything. But the moment a user has experienced using these two techs
to play games, it is very difficult to play games without these techs. Going back is very difficult.</p>


  <h2>Warranty and Customer Service</h2>
  <p>Customer service is one of those things that one doesn't really need, until one <em>really</em> needs it. Most monitor purchased are usually defect free, with the exception
    of cases where the consumer will get monitors with ghosting, dead pixels, stuck pixels, ghosting, etc... Because of this, it's important to consider how pain-free or pain-ful
    a company's RMA (return) process is.
  Consider each company's reputation and the number of warranty years they offer for their products. Typically, warranty varies from 1 year - 3 years. </p>
