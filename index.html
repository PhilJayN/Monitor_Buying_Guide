<h2>Intended Audience</h2>
<p>This guide is inteded for people pressed on time who just want to buy a monitor,
   but are are overwhelmed with the plethora of choices, buzzwords, and acronyms of the monitor market.
  There will not be any scientific writeup of all the different acronyms that one often sees,
  such as TN, IPS, VA, VMA, LCD. Furthermore, there won't be in depth discussion on the details of the different versions
  of VA panels (ex: MVA, PVA). All of that is enough to make anyone's head spin. Rather,
  the guide will help a consumer pick a monitor based on their needs and
  explain some of the concepts that's thrown around in the monitor market.</p>

<p>The primary goal is to make the monitor buying process less overwhelming and less time consuming, by presenting information
in more or less a linear pattern, with as little information as possible to explain the concepts. It aims to be
as consumer-centric as possible, without bogging down with too much detail.
Instead, it will focus on the broader picture: why a consumer
would need one panel vs another panel. </p>

<h2>Contents at a Glance</h2>
<p>Stop! Please don't let the length of the table of contents freak you out. We will
walk through it together. By the time we are done, you'll be less overwhelmed. Promise!
One step at a time is the goal. You'll be very glad you spent some time to read this
guide and do some research. Trust me when I say this because I've been through it all.
It's not worth it to randomly buy a monitor and not think it through! It's also a huge waste of time
reading through scattered resources all over the Internet to help you pick. I've experienced it all.
This is a fully comprehensive guide full of my experiences designed to help save you time. It's a purchase
you'll keep for a long time, and being happy
with this is important. Plus, your eyes will thank you! </p>

  <h2>Primary Use</h2>
  One can walk into an electronics store, close one's eyes, purchase a monitor, and be extremly happy, or extremely disssapointed.
  Therefore it's important to purchase a monitor based on <em>your</em> needs. There are monitors for gamers, graphic designers,
  programmers and analysts, and everyday use. Picking a monitor based on what you need it to do will generally result better results.
  <p>Warning: The choice you pick here will determine what options show up on the following page. For example, if you choose your
  primary use to be productivity and you never play a single game, then the monitor options for gaming will not be discusssed because, well,
you won't need it. </p>

  <h2>Pick Price Range</h2>
  It's good to have a budget and add about $50 to $100 to that budget. A monitor is something you'll mostly likely spend 8 hours a day on. Furthermore,
  many people keep monitors for years. Typically a monitor will spend about 2-10 years of its life with the same owner. Try not to divorce your monitor.
  Returning a monitor is not as easy: it's heavy, bulky, costly to ship, and many stores aren't going to accept a monitor return with open arms.
  So make sure you don't go too cheap on a monitor.

  <h2>Pick Aspect Ratio</h2>
  <p>Note: I've decided to discuss aspect ratio first, and <em>then</em> and we'
  ll talk about monitor size. It makes more sense to decide on an aspect ratio first because
you'll see soon that it determines the size. Consider this lopsided scenario: You first decide on a 23" for a size. Then you find out
that 23" doesn't come in an aspect ratio of 21:9. This is why I've decided to discuss aspect  ratios first. </p>
  <p>While monitor shoppping, you'll come into terms like aspect ratios, and
     you'll see numbers like 16:9, 16:10, 21:9, etc... Rather than getting a headache about this,
    decide what you need the monitor for. Many movies support 21:9 aspect ratio, so getting
    an ultrawide with a 21:9 aspect ratio is great. The aspect ratio 16:9 is quite common
    in mainstream stores. You'll find the majority of monitors in modern electronics store
    to fall into this range. </p>
    <p>21:9 (think ultrawide) aspect ratio is great for the following, provided that the games
    or the particular movie you are watching actually supports it:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Watching movies</li>
      <li>Playing games </li>
      <li>Content creation, movie editing, programming, excel</li>
    </ul>

    <p>16:9 aspect ratio is a great all rounder, jack of all trades</p>


  <h2>Pick a Size</h2>
  Size is a personal preference, and frankly very subjective. But some thought should go into it. 23" - 27" is the most common. Remember! Screen size and pixel
  should be picked deliberately, not haphazardly. You want screen size and resolution to mesh with each other nicely, like ketchup and french fries.
  <p>Most people would agree that a 23" with 4k resolution is not a good match. There's too many pixels on a small screen size, so text would be too small and difficult to read.
  On the other hand, 32" with a 1920 x 1080 pixel would be very pixelated. Text by default will look too big, bulky, and pixelated. Interestly, some people
  are very happy because the bigger text will be easier to read.</p>

  <p>
    The sweet spot for monitor size, though, is 27" at 2560 x 1440.
  </p>

  <h3>Screen Real Estate</h3>
  <p>Note that "screen real estate" refers to the amount of virtual space available for the user to work with,
    more space to have more windows and applications all opened all at the same time, side by side. A 27" monitor
    at 2560 x 1440 will provide more space to work with than a 27" monitor at 1920 x 1080. </p>

    <h1>ADD HERE A TABLE COMPARING TOTAL NUM OF PIXELS WITH VARIOUS SIZES.</h1>

    <h4>For Programmers, Analysts, etc...</h4>
    Programmers, analysts, and any user who constantly have text editors and Excel spreadsheets opened will enjoy having more
  "screen real estate.

  <h2>Pick a Panel</h2>

  <div class="hidden-container">
    <p></p>

    <h3>IPS (In-Plane Switching)</h3>
    <p>You most likely have an IPS right next to you! Check your phone. More often than not,
      it is equipped with an IPS panel because phone screens need to look great, regardless
      how the consumer holds it. IPS panels can be described as "vibrant", "colorful", and "lively",
      with great viewing angles, and thus less color shift.
      To better demonstrate viewing angle, take your phone screen and move its screen in different direction.
      You'll notice that the colors of the picture will change very little, even at different angle. This is the
      power of an IPS panel.
    </p>
    <p>Some people like IPS because it allows them to lay down on the ground
      and exercise (do situp, pushups) while watching a movie. IPS panel's viewing angle also allow two or more people to
      sit next to a screen and watch a movie together, or work on project together: Both people will be able to
      see the same color and clarity.
      Due to the amazing viewing angles, the colors remain  consistent. Try doing this
      with TN panels, and you'll discover that the pictures will have yellow to it, or look completely washed out.

        <p>Gaming side note: If you like to play games like Skyrim and like to mod and add ENB
         heck out of the game, then an IPS panel is your friend. The colors of an IPS will blow
       other panels out of the water for this special case use. But playing competitive FPS will find it beneficial to
     get a monitor with high refresh rates and quick response time. </p>
        <h4>Panel Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Picking a panel is about compromise and knowing what you'll use the
        monitor for. Gamers will like TN panels for their faster response time.
        But there is nothing stopping a gamer from getting an IPS pannel with 244hz when it
        comes out, but be prepare to cough up $$$ [INSERT LINK TO MONITOR IPS WITH HIGH REFRESH]
        Graphic designers will like VA (for great color production) or IPS for their viewing angles.
        Programmers will like IPS for their ability to look good even in portrait mode.
        But picking a panel without some research can lead to dissapointment.</p>

  <h2>Pick Finish</h2>
  <p>Screen Finish</p>

  <p>There is a misconception that people have about IPS panels being "glossy", or "too shiny".
  This is WRONG and likely comes from the fact that phones and tablet (which typically have IPS panels)
  are by nature very glossy, shiny, and reflective. The panel type has nothing do with
  how reflective or non-reflective a screen looks. Rather, it's just a matter of the type of coating a
  manufacturer decides to put onto the monitor.
  </p>

  <p>A monitor being matte or glossy is a matter of personal preference (and in some cases, color reproduction). Back in the 1990s,
    companies sold matte screens to put over monitors to give the user some privacy and make the monitors less shiny.
    Nowadays, monitor technology is so good that even matte screen look amazing compared to their glossy counterpart. Some people

  must have a matte monitor at all cost, while some just don't care at all. </p>

  <p>For those who care, this section is perfect for you.</p>

  <p>Matte monitors offer the following advantages:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Less annoyance due to less reflection</li>
    <li>Less eyestrain (subjectively)</li>
    <li>Untainted picture quality because outside objects aren't reflected into monitor</li>
  </ul>


  <ul>
    <li>Cannot see people's reflection sneaking behind you</li>

  </ul>

  <h4>How to Tell if Monitor's Screen is Glossy or Matte</h4>
  <p>Typically, the product specifications will use the following keywords:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Anti-glare</li>
    <li>Anti-glare coating</li>
    <li>Matte finish, matte screen</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you are unable to find this information, consider looking at the monitor's manuals, which
  you can typically find by typing "[monitor model name] manual" into Google.
  Dell.com has an amazing search engine for their monitors. If you still cannot find the information, consider going to Reddit's many
  subreddits, such as /r/monitors, /r/pcmasterrace, /r/ultrawidemasterrace and asking there. Just make sure to do some research and mention that you've
tried looking for specs and manuals but couldn't find it. You'll increase your chances of getting help if you
make some sort of attempt to research first.</p>

  <p></p>

  <h3>Pick Eye Care Tech</h3>
  <p>Do you suffer from migrane, headaches, or eyestrain while using the computer?
  If so, then getting a monitor with flicker free technology will be beneficial.</p>
  <p>Typically, each company has their own names for this technology, but its function remains the same.
  Be on the lookout for naming:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Acer - Flicker-less</li>
    <li>Asus - Eye care</li>
    <li>LG - Flicker safe</li>
    <li>BenQ - ZeroFlicker or Flicker-free</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pick Mounting Option and Vesa Support</h3>
  If you do not have any plans on mounting your monitor on a stand, and would like to use the default stand
  that comes with the monitor, then there is no need to consider whether a monitor comes with Vesa mounts.
  If you're opting for the default monitor stand, consider the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Height adjust - For ergonomic reasons, you want to be able to adjust the monitor up and down as you please</li>
    <li>Pivot and tilt - A nice stand should offer these, if you decide you want
    movement freedom</li>
    <li>Landscape and portrait mode - Some people prefer to orient their monitors in
    a portrait position to allow them to have more vertical space.
     </li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Vesa Mounting</h4>
  <p>If you're unsure whether you want to use the stand or Vesa mount in the future,
  then spend the extra money now to make sure you have Vesa mounting option, should you
  ever decide you want it. You'll find yourself in a predicament should you want to
  use Vesa mount in the future and your monitor lacks it. However, there adapters
  to use for monitors without Vesa mount holes, but a monitor with built in Vesa mount holes will
  give you less headaches.
</p>

<h3>Pick X-Sync Technology: G-sync or Freesync</h3>
<h4>Lets talk about $$$ upfront</h4>
<p> These two techs will add more cost to a monitor, with G-sync typically
   costing more ($100 - $200) than AMD's Freesync. If you have a budget, get Freesync. Note: If you want to utilize
 a monitor with Freesync, you need a AMD GPU. Similarily, if you want to utilize a monitor with G-sync, you'll need
an Nvidia GPU. </p>
<p>Nvidia's G-sync and AMD's Freesync is another debate and discussion that could takes hours or days,
and the differences and similarities between these two tech will takes pages of write-up. So to keep it simple,
just keep in mind that G-sync and Freesync will give gamers a "smooth, buttery feeling. Some would consider
G-sync and Freesync to be a luxury, while others consider these two technology a must have. But for all intents
and purposes, for the average consumer, G-sync and Freesync will be a luxury item because it adds
to the price of the monitor.
 </p>
 <p>It is important to note that if a user has never experienced G-sync for Freesync, then
 the user will not miss out on anything. But the moment a user has experienced using these two techs
to play games, it is very difficult to play games without these techs. Going back is very difficult.</p>


  <h2>Warranty and Customer Service</h2>
  <p>Warning: What I'm about to say next is very opinionated, but I hope that you'll consider it while making a purchase decision:
    When buying monitor, consider both the seller and the manufacturer's reputation and customer service.
    Customer service is one of those things that one doesn't really need, until one <em>really</em> needs it. Most monitor purchased are usually defect free, with the exception
    of cases where the consumer will get monitors with ghosting, dead pixels, stuck pixels, ghosting, etc... Because of this, it's important to consider how pain-free or pain-ful
    a company's RMA (return) process is.     It's not a good feeling to be on the receiving end of bad luck with a poor quality monitor and have to deal with terrible customer service.
    You'll end up talking to the bad seller, who will advise you to contact the manfucturer, who has a headache inducing customer service department who will
    make you ride a roller coaster to get your monitor fixed. At this point, you'll wish that you had spent the extra dollars and purchased from a reputable seller and manufacturer. Also,
  consider each company's reputation and the number of warranty years they offer for their products. Typically, warranty varies from 1 year - 3 years. </p>



  <h3>Pick a Refresh Rate</h3>
  <p>I'm going to keep it simple with refresh rates: Get a monitor with the highest refresh
  rate that you can afford AND that your GPU can handle. Typically monitors with high
  refresh rates will cost more. </p>
  <p>The average mainstream monitor comes with refresh rate of 60hz, so you'll get your
  standard 60fps gameplay. This is enough for most people, and it will give a very good
gaming experience. If you decide to go for monitors with much higher refresh rates,
make sure to do more research and look at benchmarks to be sure that your current GPU
can actually utlize high refresh rates. </p>
  <p>So what happens if you decide to get a monitor with a high refresh rate but your GPU
  cannot put out enough frames per second? Lets say you get a monitor with 144hz, but
  your GPU can only push out 60fps on a game because it's not powerful enough? Well, nothing bad happens, but you just won't be able
  to utulize all that high refresh rate goodness. You can always upgrade your GPU later on.</p>
  <p>One thing to keep in mind is that if a user has never expeienced higher refresh rates,
  they won't miss anything. Life goes on as normal. But if a user has been playing on a 144hz monitor,
and they have to go back to a 60hz monitor, they will feel the pain because game play will not feel
buttery smooth anymore. It's the same situation with x-sync technology: If you've never used it,
don't worry, you're not missing out. But if you use it, you cannot go back.</p>

<h3>Other Considerations</h3>

<h4>Ports</h4>
<p>There are a few things to consider before finalizing your purchase:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Make sure your GPU has the correct ports that the monitor needs. Display port,
  HMDI, DVI, etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure that your grphi</p>
<h3>Pick misc features</h3>
<p>Finally, when doing shopping, you'll see that certain monitors come with "extra"
  features, such as Blue light filter and speakers. These features should not make or
break your buying decision. If you want blue light filter, get flux. If you want good sound,
get dedicated speakers. </p>
<p>Somep people prefer built in speakers in a monitor, and that's absolutely fine! Although the sound quality
won't be amazing, built-in speakers sound pretty decent and are great for people who don't need to blast bass
at 1000% and who prefer a clean desk without bulky speaker and subwoofer setups.</p>
