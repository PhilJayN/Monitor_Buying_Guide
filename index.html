      find a monitor that suits you.</p>
      <p>Note: This a work in progress, and it isn't designed to be a 100% complete guide. That would always never
      come to fruition simply because the monitor market changes. The guide however, should give you a good starting point
      . This gives you the knowledge you need to research more deeply in your own time if you feel like going deeper.
      Many people who have read this guide have express a similar thought: This guide saves them time. Researching monitors
      in today's market is a huge headache because the information is scattered all over.</p>

    <p>This guide is intended for people pressed on time who just want to buy a monitor,
       but are are overwhelmed with the plethora of choices, buzzwords, and acronyms of the monitor market.
      There will not be scientific explaination of all the different acronyms,
      such as TN, IPS, VA, VMA, LCD. All of that is enough to make anyone's head spin.
      Instead, the guide will help consumers pick a monitor based on <em>their</em> needs
      and discuss why a consumer would want or not want a particular monitor feature.</p>

    <p>This guide is for you if you fit any of the following:</p>
    <ul class="primary-content-ul">
      <li><span>You're new to the monitor market, or have never purchased a monitor by yourself. </span></li>
      <li><span>You have not purchased a monitor in years and need a refresher.</span></li>
      <li><span>You're overwhelmed with the plethora of monitor choices and terminologies.</span></li>
      <li><span>You have a budget in mind, and/or want to buy a monitor with the "best bang for your buck".
        Have extra money to splurge, and want the top of the line, jammed packed with features? There's a separate page for that here. </span></li>
      <li><span>You are a busy person who still has a bit of time to do research before purchasing.</span></li>
      <li><span>You don't really care about the scientific principles of TN, IPS, VA panels, but just
        want to know which one is best suited for you.</span></li>
      <li><span>You ready to buy a monitor but a bit hesistant and need checklist before making a final purchase.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>The primary goal is to make the monitor buying process less overwhelming and
      less time consuming, by presenting information
    in more or less a linear pattern, using only as little or as much information needed
    to explain a concept or feature.</p>

    <p class="side-note"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note-o" aria-hidden="true"><span> Side note</span></i>
       You might come across the occasional and very obvious things in this guide, like
      saying it's important to consider buying a monitor from a good manufacturer and a good retailer.
      Some people might think this is the most obvious thing, while others might not
      have considered that in the buying process. It's important to think about these things.
      I am <strong>not</strong> trying to insult your intelligence
    by saying some obvious things. I just want to make sure everyone is on the same page and that all bases are covered.
     </p>

  <aside class="contents-section">
    <h2>Wishlist and Criteria Tool</h2>
    <p>The wishlist and criteria is designed to help you keep track of the various
    monitor criteria and features that you think you might want as you read through the guide. It's
    recommended that you use it, as you'll find that the monitor market has a dizzying
    amount of terms and acronyms. </p>
    <p>The wishlist and criteria list is useful because it gives you
    something at the end you can save/print/take while looking for that "perfect" monitor.
    You might find it especially useful to bring your own customized wishlist
    with you if you choose to buy your monitor at a physical shopping store.
    There's a button to hide it below should you find it obtrusive. </p>

    <p class="side-note"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note-o" aria-hidden="true"><span> Side note</span></i>
       I'll break your heart right now: There is no such thing as perfect monitor. There will usually be tradeoffs.
       A monitor can have this feature, but will miss a certain feature. So it's important to realize now.

  <h2>Introduction</h4>
  <div class="row marketing legend">
    <div class="col-lg-6">
    <h4>Size</h4>
      <p>In the world of monitors, size is subjective. You'll often hear
      the terms too big or too small thrown around. The size that works for one
    person might not work for others. Keep this in mind as you do monitor research. Follow
     the general pattern of what the majority of people accept, and you should generally be okay.
     One caveat: Sometimes the majority can parrot wrong information, just because it's what
    they hear often.</p>

    <h5>Why I Wrote this Guide</h5>
    <p>I don't want people to make the same headache inducing and time wasting mistakes
      as I did with my monitor experiences. When I was younger,
      I needed a monitor, but I didn't have a clue what to pick. I went to a local store, looked around for
      a few minutes, and made my first purchase based on whatever looked good at the moment, in the store.
      My first monitor was a mistake and it had all sorts
      of problems.</p>
    <p>Then I decided to research on the Internet about monitors. Hours later, all
      I got was a migrane. The information was
    scattered all over, and I didn't have the slightest clue on what keywords to look for.</p>
    <p>I was  very frustrated because the information on the Internet was very scattered. When I
      finally found a good guide, it was still lacking: It discussed interesting monitor features, but
      didn't tell me why I would need or not need that feature.</p>
      <p>I don't want other people to go through the frustration I went through.
      This guide is full of my experiences that's designed to help save you time.</p>
     <p>When you buy the right monitor for you, your eyes, your heart, and your wallet will thank you!
      It's a purchase
      you'll keep for a long time, so make sure you're truly happy with it.

      <h4>Legend</h4>
      <p>Throughout the guide, you'll see little icons scattered throughout the text.
      You're free to ignore and skip most of these, as they will not have too much impact
      on the end result. However, pay attention to any exclamation icons you see. They could
      save you tons of time and headache.</p>

  <h2>Primary Use</h2>
  <p>How much time you spend on a certain task or activity on your computer ultimately determines the kind
  of monitor you should get. There are monitors for gamers, graphic designers,
    programmers and analysts, and everyday use. It's important to purchase a
    monitor based on <em>your</em> needs, not
  on what another users says, and not on what companies advertise.</p>

  <p class="side-warning"> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"><span> Warning!</span></i>
    The choice you pick here will determine what options and/or dicussion will show up or not show up after this section.
    For example, if you choose your
    primary use to be productivity and you never, or rarely ever play video games, then
    the main section discussing monitors for gaming will not be discusssed.

  <h2>Primary Use</h2>
  One can walk into an electronics store, close one's eyes, purchase a monitor, and be extremly happy, or extremely disssapointed.
  Therefore it's important to purchase a monitor based on <em>your</em> needs. There are monitors for gamers, graphic designers,
  programmers and analysts, and everyday use. Picking a monitor based on what you need it to do will generally result better results.
  <p>Warning: The choice you pick here will determine what options show up on the following page. For example, if you choose your
  primary use to be productivity and you never play a single game, then the monitor options for gaming will not be discusssed because, well,
  you won't need it. </p>
  </section> -->

  <section class="contents-section">
    <h2>Pick Price Range</h2>
    <p>It's good to have a budget and add about $50 to $100 to that budget. A monitor is something you'll mostly likely spend 8 hours a day on. Furthermore,
    many people keep monitors for years. Typically a monitor will spend about 2-10 years of its life with the same owner. Try not to divorce your monitor.
    Returning a monitor is not as easy: it's heavy, bulky, costly to ship, and many stores aren't going to accept a monitor return with open arms.
    Do your best to pick and buy a monitor because you love it, not because you "kinda like it", or "it's okay". Don't settle!

  <h2>Pick Aspect Ratio</h2>
  <p class="definitions"><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"><span> Defintion</span></i>
    Aspect ratio: Describes the proportional relationship of the image's width and height.
    A 1920 x 1080 monitor with an aspect ratio of 16:9 means that the monitor has
    more pixels at its width than it has pixels at its height.
   </p>

   <p>While monitor shoppping, you'll see numbers like 16:9, 16:10, 21:9, etc...
     Don't give yourself a headache thinking about this. Just
    decide what activity you'll primarily be doing on the monitor and pick based on that.

    <p>Consider 21:9 ultrawides if any of the following applies to you:</p>
    <ul class="primary-content-ul">
      <li><span>You have some extra cash. (Ultrawides typically cost more)</span></li>
      <li><span>You've tried dual or triple monitor setup and are bothered by bezels of many monitors all in line.</span></li>
      <li><span>You're a programmer who likes to have command prompt, text editor, browser,
        etc... all opened at the same time.</span></li>
      <li><span>You like playing RPGS or FPS games.</span></li>
      <li><span>You are a content or movie editor who uses Audacity, Adobe premiere.</span></li>
      <li><span>You're constantly using excel and are tired of side scrolling extra wide spreadsheets.</span></li>
      <li><span>You love watching movies that support 21:9 because it's more immersive.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="side-warning"> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"><span> Warning!</span></i>
    Ultrawide is great but make that the particular game
      or movie actually supports it.</p>
    </p>

    <!-- <p>21:9 ultrawide is great for the following, -->
    <!-- <ul class="primary-content-ul">
      <li><span>Watching movies</span></li>
      <li><span>Playing games</span></li>
      <li><span>Content creation, movie editing, programming, excel. You appreciate the
      extra width top open more windows or expand current widow.</span></li>
    </ul> -->


    <p>16:9 aspect ratio is a great all rounder, jack of all trades. It is quite common
    in mainstream retail stores.</p>
    <p>Consider 16:9 if any of the following applies to you:</p>
    <ul class="primary-content-ul">
      <li><span>You dislike black bars that ultrawides show on unsupported movies and games. </span></li>
      <li><span>You like watching more TV shows than movies, since many TV shows support 16:9</span></li>

    <h2>Pick Screen Size</h2>
    <p>
    Screen size and pixel should be picked deliberately, not haphazardly.
    Even though size is a personal preference, some thought should go into it.
    You want screen size and resolution to mesh with each other nicely, like ketchup and french fries.
    </p>
    <p>A 23" monitor with 3840 x 2160 resolution is not a good match if you're reading
      lots of text. There's too many pixels on a screen that small, so text would be
      too small and difficult to read. Text on a 32" monitor with a 1920 x 1080
      would look big, bulky, and pixelated.
    </p>
    <p>I will reiterate again and again that size is a personal preference.
      Interestly, certain groups of people whose eyesight is below average might find happiness
      on a 32" monitor at 1920 x 1080 due to the larger default text.
    </p>
    <p class="side-note"><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"><span> Side note</span></i>
      To get a frame of reference, 23" - 27" is the most common screen size.
      The sweet spot for monitor size, if you had only 2 seconds to pick, would be 27" at 2560 x 1440.
     </p>

    <h4>Screen Real Estate</h4>
    <p>Note that "screen real estate" refers to the amount of display space available
      for the user to work with. Generally, more screen real estate is preferable, especially
       for productivity. It allows the user to have more windows and applications all opened
       at the same time, side by side. You could have a browser on the left, a word document
       in the middle, and a folder explorer to the right. No more alt tabbing and switching windows!
       For reference, a 27" monitor at 2560 x 1440 will provide more screen real estate than a 27" monitor at 1920 x 1080. </p>

<section class="contents-section">
  <h2>Pick a Resolution</h2>

  <p class="definitions"><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"><span> Defintion</span></i>
     Display resolution: The number of distinct pixels that a display device (in our case a monitor)
     can have shown on it. It is described by width x height, with units measured in pixels.
     Example: 1920 pixels x 1080 pixels, or more commonly shown as 1920 x 1080.
   </p>

  <p>If you ask 10 people their opinions on a resolution you should get for your monitor,
    you'll probably get 10 different answers. And here's why: Resolution
  deals greatly with personal preferences and special use case for the monitor.
 </p>
 <p>Some people prefer really sharp and crispy text, while others prefer
   bigger text. So to find the best resolution for <em>you</em>,
  first discover what you need to use the monitor for.</p>

  <p>Consider the following when picking a resolution:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Eyesight - If you have good eyesight, you can go for higher resolution
      as the text will be smaller but clearer and "crispier". </span></li>
    <!-- <li><span>Operating system (OS) - OS handles text scaling differently. MAC OS does not
      seem to have issues with high DPI as previous versions of windows. </span></li> -->
      <li><span>Distance from monitor - Having your eyes approximately 20 inches
        away from a monitor screen is a good distance,
      but if you sit closer or farther from a monitor, then pick a resolution accordingly.
      If you like sitting close, you can pick a higher resolution.  If you like sitting
       far away, you can pick a lower resolution. However, sitting 35 inches away while using a
       23" monitor at 3840 x 2160 is asking for trouble because the text will be too small.
     </span></li>
    <li><span>Primary use - If you work mainly with text, go for higher resolution.</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: Different groups of people will answer monitor related resolution questions differently.
    If you ask gamers if you should buy a 27" 2560 x 1440 or a 32" 2560 x 1440, then
    you'll probalby get a different response than if you had asked a programmer or writer.
    The former won't care to much about resolution, but rather more about refresh rates. The latter
    will care more about resolution because they are reading text all day.
    But if you ask me -- programmer and gamer who has eyesight a tad bit
    above average -- then I'll
    tell you that 27" 2560 x 1440 if great for text <em>and</em> gaming, but 32" 2560 x 1440 is great gaming
    but not for text because there's not enough pixel on a screen size that's too already too big.
  </p>

  <p>Note: Remember that there will be outliers. You'll occasionally run across people who
  will say: "I sit 35 inches away from my 23" 3840 x 2160 monitor, and I can see everything just fine!"
  Listen to your own research and follow the general patterns of the average person, not outliers. These people
just have amazing hawk-like eye sight, or a special setup for their monitors. </p>

<p>Note: Windows does have a built in text scaling. So if you purchase a 3840 x 2160 and find that the
  text size is too small, there is option to change the size of the text. However, the text will be more pixelated.
You'll usually get the best result if you keep the scaling at the default value of 100%. </p>

  <p>Question:</p>
  <p>If I go from a 24" 1920 x 1080 to a 27" 1920 x 1080 , is that an upgrade?
    For the most part, no. You are still working with the same number of pixels, just on a larger screen.
  Text won't be as crisp because the pixels are much larger.</p>

  <h2>Pick a Panel</h2>
  <!-- <div> -->
    <h4>IPS (In-Plane Switching)</h4>
    <p>You most likely have an IPS panel right next to you! Check your phone. More often than not,
      it is equipped with an IPS panel. Phone screens need to look great, regardless
      how the consumer hold or view it. IPS panels can be described as "vibrant", "colorful", and/or "lively",
      with great viewing angles, and thus less color shift.
      To better demonstrate viewing angle and why its useful, take your phone screen and
      move its screen in different direction. You'll notice that the colors of the
      picture will change very little. This is a huge advantage of an IPS panel.
    </p>
    <p>Having an IPS panel for monitor can be advantageous. Some people like IPS because
      it allows them to lay down on the ground or exercise on the floor while watching a
      movie . Futhermore, IPS panel's viewing angle also allow two or more people to
      sit next to a screen and watch a movie together, or work on project together: Both people
      will be able to see images and text with the same color and clarity.
      Due to the amazing viewing angles, the colors remain  consistent. Try doing this
      with TN panels, and you'll discover that the pictures will have yellow to it, or look completely washed out.

        <h4>Panel Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Picking a panel is about compromise and knowing what you'll use the
        monitor for. Gamers will like TN panels for their faster response time and affordability.
        However, there is nothing stopping a gamer from getting an IPS pannel with super high refresh rates,
        and quick response time,
        but be prepare to cough up $$$ [INSERT LINK TO MONITOR IPS WITH HIGH REFRESH]
        Graphic designers will like VA for great color production or IPS for awesome the viewing angles.
        Programmers will like IPS for its ability to look good even in portrait mode.

  <h2>Pick Finish</h2>

  <p>A monitor being matte or glossy is a matter of personal preference
    (and in some cases, color reproduction). Back in the 1990s,
    companies sold matte screens to put over monitors to give the user some privacy
    and make the monitors less glossy.
    Nowadays, monitor technology is so good that even matte screen look amazing
    compared to their glossy counterpart. Some people
    must have a matte monitor at all cost, while some just don't care at all. </p>

  <p>Matte monitor advantages:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Less annoyance due to less reflection</span></li>
    <li><span>Less eyestrain </span></li>
    <li><span>Untainted picture quality because outside objects aren't reflected into monitor</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Matte monitor disadvantages:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Inability see people's reflection sneaking behind you</span></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How to Tell if Monitor's Screen is Glossy or Matte</h4>
  <p>Typically, the product specifications will use the following keywords:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Anti-glare</span></li>
    <li><span>Anti-glare coating</span></li>
    <li><span>Matte finish, matte screen</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you are unable to find this information, consider looking at the monitor's manuals, which
  you can typically find by typing "[monitor model name] manual" into Google.
  Dell.com has an amazing search engine for their monitors. If you still cannot find the information, consider going to Reddit's many
  subreddits, such as /r/monitors, /r/pcmasterrace, /r/ultrawidemasterrace and asking there. Just make sure to do some research and mention that you've
tried looking for specs and manuals but couldn't find it. You'll increase your chances of getting help if you
make some sort of attempt to research first.</p>


<p class="side-note"><i class="fa fa-book" aria-hidden="true"><span> Side note</span></i>
  There is a misconception that people have about IPS panels being "glossy", or "too shiny".
  This is <strong>wrong</strong> and likely comes from the fact that phones and tablet
  (which typically have IPS panels)
  are by nature very glossy, shiny, and reflective. So it's understandable that some people
  affiliate IPS with glossiness.
  To clarify, the panel type has nothing do with
  how reflective or non-reflective a screen looks. Rather, it's just a matter of the type of coating a
  manufacturer decides to put on the monitor.

  <h2>Pick Mounting Option and VESA Support</h2>
  <p>
  If you do not have plans on mounting your monitor on an extendable or flexible monitor arm,
  and prefer to use the default stand that comes with the monitor, check to see if
   the built-in stand has any or all the following options:
  </p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Height adjust - For ergonomic reasons, you want to be able to adjust the monitor up and down.</span></li>
    <li><span>Pivot and tilt - A quality stand should offer these</span></li>
    <li><span>Landscape and portrait mode - Some people prefer the freedom to orient their monitor in
    a landscape or portrait position (for more vertical space).</span></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Vesa Mounting</h4>
  <p>If you're unsure whether you want to use the stand or Vesa mount in the future,
  then buy a monitor with Vesa mounting option, should you
  ever decide you want it. You'll find yourself in a predicament should you want to
  use Vesa mount in the future and your monitor lacks it. There are adapters
  to use for monitors that do not come with VESA mount holes, but a monitor with built in VESA will
  give you less headaches.

<h2>Pick X-Sync Technology: G-sync or Freesync</h2>
<h4>Lets talk about cost upfront</h4>
<p> These two techs will add more cost to a monitor, with G-sync typically
   costing $100 - $200 more than AMD's Freesync. If you have a budget, get Freesync. </p>
<p>Nvidia's G-sync and AMD's Freesync is another debate and discussion that could more time.
   To keep it simple, just keep in mind that G-sync and Freesync will give gamers a "smooth, buttery feeling".
   Some would consider G-sync and Freesync to be a luxury, while others consider
   these two technology a must have. But for all intents
   and purposes, for the average consumer, Freesync, and especially G-sync will be a luxury item because it adds
   to the price of the monitor.
 </p>
 <p>It is important to note that if a user has never experienced G-sync for Freesync, then
 the user will not miss out on anything. But the moment a user has experienced using these two techs
to play games, it is very difficult to play games without these techs. There's no going back once you've used it.</p>
<p>Remember, the choice that you make whether to go G-sync or Freesync is permanent for
the lifespan of your monitor. You will be effectively "locking" yourself into a company
by buying a technology. Let me elaborate: If you buy a monitor with Nvidia's G-sync, then all future GPU purchases
you make should be Nvidia, if you want to utilize G-sync. It's a little wasteful
to have a monitor that supports G-sync sitting there, not being used to its full potential. Of course, you could
always sell the monitor, or just use the monitor without using G-sync. Just something to consider.</p>

<p class="side-warning"> <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle" aria-hidden="true"><span> Warning!</span></i>
   If you want to utilize
  a monitor with Freesync, you need an AMD GPU. Similarily, if you want to utilize a monitor with G-sync, you'll need
  an Nvidia GPU.

  <h2>Warranty and Customer Service</h2>
  <p>
    "Customer service is one of those things that you don't really need. But when
    you need it, you <em>really</em> need it."
  </p>

  <p> When buying monitor, consider both the seller and the manufacturer's reputation and customer service.
    Most monitors are usually defect free, with the exception
    of cases where the consumer will get monitors with ghosting, dead pixels,
    stuck pixels, etc... Because of this, it's important to consider how pain-free or pain-full
    a company's RMA (return) process is.  </p>

    <p>It's not a good feeling to be on the receiving end of bad luck with a poor
      quality monitor and have to deal with terrible customer service on the side.
    You'll end up talking to the bad seller, who will advise you to contact the manfucturer,
    who has a headache inducing customer service department who will
    make you ride a roller coaster to get your monitor fixed. At this point,
    you'll wish that you had spent the extra dollars and purchased from a reputable seller and manufacturer.
    <p>
      Remember to consider each company's reputation and the number of warranty years they offer for their products. Typically, warranty varies from 1 year - 3 years. </p>

  <h2>Pick a Refresh Rate</h2>
  <p>I'm going to keep it simple with refresh rates: Get a monitor with the highest refresh
  rate that you can afford <strong>and</strong> that your GPU can handle. Typically monitors with high
  refresh rates will cost more. </p>
  <p>The average mainstream monitor comes with a refresh rate of 60hz, so you'll get up to 60fps with video games,
    as long as your GPU can push out those frames. If you decide to go for monitors with higher refresh rates,
make sure to do more research and look at benchmarks to be sure that your current GPU
can actually utlize high refresh rates. </p>
  <p>What happens if you decide to get a monitor with a high refresh rate fo 144hz but your GPU
  is not powerful enough to push out more frames per second? Well, nothing bad happens,
  but you just won't be able to utulize all that high refresh rate goodness, until you upgrade your GPU.</p>
  <p>One thing to keep in mind is that if a user has never experienced higher refresh rates,
  they won't miss anything because there's no frame of reference to compare anything to.
   But if a user has been playing on a 144hz monitor for a while,
   and they have to go back to a 60hz monitor, they will feel the pain.
  Game play will not feel buttery smooth anymore. It's the same situation with x-sync technology: If you've never used it,
don't worry, you're not missing out. But if you use it, it's difficult to go back.</p>


<button type="button" class="btn btn-default">60hz</button>

<section class="contents-section">
  <h2>Other Considerations</h2>

  <p>Considering the following before finalizing your purchase, as they might save
  you some minor headaches:</p>

  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Make sure your GPU has the correct ports that the monitor needs: Display Port, HMDI, DVI, etc..</span></li>
    <li><span>If cable length is important to you, buy additional cables, as the default cables are only around 3 feet.</span></li>
  </ul>



  <h3>Pick Miscellaneous Features</h3>
  <p>Sometimes you'll see that certain monitors come with extra
    features, such as Blue light filter and speakers. These features should not make or
  break your buying monitor decision because there are alternative solutions:
  If you want blue light filter, get flux. If you want great sound, get dedicated speakers. </p>
  <p>Some people prefer built in speakers in a monitor, and that's absolutely fine! Although the sound quality
  won't be amazing, built-in speakers sound pretty decent and are great for people who don't need to blast bass
  at 1000% and who prefer a clean desk without bulky speaker and subwoofer setups.</p>
