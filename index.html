  <h3>Pick Eye Care Tech</h3>
  <p>Do you suffer from migrane, headaches, or eyestrain while using the computer?
  If so, then getting a monitor with flicker free technology will be beneficial.</p>
  <p>Typically, each company has their own names for this technology, but its function remains the same.
  Be on the lookout for naming:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Acer - Flicker-less</li>
    <li>Asus - Eye care</li>
    <li>LG - Flicker safe</li>
    <li>BenQ - ZeroFlicker or Flicker-free</li>
  </ul>


  <h2>Warranty and Customer Service</h2>
  <p>Customer service is one of those things that one doesn't really need, until one <em>really</em> needs it. Most monitor purchased are usually defect free, with the exception
    of cases where the consumer will get monitors with ghosting, dead pixels, stuck pixels, ghosting, etc... Because of this, it's important to consider how pain-free or pain-ful
    a company's RMA (return) process is.
  Consider each company's reputation and the number of warranty years they offer for their products. Typically, warranty varies from 1 year - 3 years. </p>
