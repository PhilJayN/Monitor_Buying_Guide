    <h2>Intended Audience</h2>

    <p>This guide is intended for people pressed on time who just want to buy a monitor,
       but are are overwhelmed with the plethora of choices, buzzwords, and acronyms of the monitor market.
      There will not be scientific explaination of all the different acronyms,
      such as TN, IPS, VA, VMA, LCD. All of that is enough to make anyone's head spin.
      Instead, the guide will help consumers pick a monitor based on <em>their</em> needs
      and discuss why a consumer would want or not want a particular monitor feature.</p>

    <p>The primary goal is to make the monitor buying process less overwhelming and
      less time consuming, by presenting information
    in more or less a linear pattern, using only as little or as much information needed
    to explain a concept or feature.</p>

    <p>This guide is for you if you fit any of the following:</p>
    <ul class="primary-content-ul">
      <li><span>You're new to the monitor market, or have never purchased a monitor by yourself. </span></li>
      <li><span>You have not purchased a monitor in years and need a refresher.</span></li>
      <li><span>You're overwhelmed with the plethora of monitor choices and terminologies.</span></li>
      <li><span>You have a budget in mind, and/or want to buy a monitor with the "best bang for your buck".
        Have extra money to splurge, and want the top of the line, jammed packed with features? There's a separate page for that here. </span></li>
      <li><span>You are a busy person who still has a bit of time to do research before purchasing.</span></li>
      <li><span>You don't really care about the scientific principles of TN, IPS, VA panels, but just
        want to know which one is best suited for you.</span></li>
      <li><span>You ready to buy a monitor but a bit hesistant and need checklist before making a final purchase.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p class="side-note"><i class="fa fa-sticky-note-o" aria-hidden="true"><span> Side note</span></i>
       You might come across the occasional and very obvious things in this guide, like
      saying it's important to consider buying a monitor from a good manufacturer and a good retailer.
      Some people might think this is the most obvious thing, while others might not
      have considered that in the buying process. It's important to think about these things.
      I am <strong>not</strong> trying to insult your intelligence
    by saying some obvious things. I just want to make sure everyone is on the same page and that all bases are covered.

    <h2>Wishlist and Criteria Tool</h2>
    <p>The wishlist and criteria is designed to help you keep track of the various
    monitor criteria that you think you might want as you read through the guide. It's
    recommended that you use it, as you'll find that the monitor market will throw out
    many terms and acronyms. The goal of the wishlist and criteria list is to give you
    something that you can save/print/take while looking for that perfect monitor.
    You might find it especially useful to bring your own customized wishlist
    with you if you choose to buy your monitor at a physical shopping store.
    You have the option to hide it should you find it obtrusive. </p>

  <h2>Primary Use</h2>
  One can walk into an electronics store, close one's eyes, purchase a monitor,
  and be extremly happy, or extremely dissapointed.
  How much time you spend on a certain task or activity ultimate determines the kind
  of monitor you should get. It's important to purchase a monitor based on <em>your</em> needs.
  There are monitors for gamers, graphic designers,
  programmers and analysts, and everyday use.
  <p>Warning: The choice you pick here will determine what options show up or not show up on the following page.
  For example, if you choose your
  primary use to be productivity and you never, or rarely ever play video games, then
  the main section discussing monitors for gaming will not be discusssed because, well, you won't need it.
  There's absolutely no point in spending $1,100 dollars on a G-sync monitor when
  you only use it for light web browsing and email, because you thought that more money means higher quality.</p>

  <p>Although true in most/many cases, more money does not necessarily mean higher quality.
    Don't pay for options you don't need.</p>

  <h2>Pick Price Range</h2>
  <p>
  It's good to have a budget and add about $50 to $100 to that budget. A monitor is something you'll mostly likely spend 8 hours a day on. Furthermore,
  many people keep monitors for years. Typically a monitor will spend about 2-10 years of its life with the same owner. Try not to divorce your monitor.
  Returning a monitor is not as easy: it's heavy, bulky, costly to ship, and many stores aren't going to accept a monitor return with open arms.
  Do your best to pick and buy a monitor because you love it, not because you "kinda like it", or "it's okay". Don't settle!

<section class="contents-section">
  <h2>Pick Aspect Ratio</h2>
  <p>Note: I've decided to discuss aspect ratio first, and <em>then</em> and we'
  ll talk about monitor size. It makes more sense to decide on an aspect ratio first because
you'll see soon that it determines the size. Consider this lopsided scenario: You first decide on a 23" for a size. Then you find out
that 23" doesn't come in an aspect ratio of 21:9. This is why I've decided to discuss aspect  ratios first. </p>
  <p>While monitor shoppping, you'll come into terms like aspect ratios, and
     you'll see numbers like 16:9, 16:10, 21:9, etc... Rather than getting a headache about this,
    decide what you need the monitor for. Many movies support 21:9 aspect ratio, so getting
    an ultrawide with a 21:9 aspect ratio is great. The aspect ratio 16:9 is quite common
    in mainstream stores. You'll find the majority of monitors in modern electronics store
    to fall into this range. </p>
    <p>21:9 (think ultrawide) aspect ratio is great for the following, provided that the games
    or the particular movie you are watching actually supports it:</p>
    <ul class="primary-content-ul">
      <li><span>Watching movies</span></li>
      <li><span>Playing games</span></li>
      <li><span>Content creation, movie editing, programming, excel</span></li>
    </ul>

    <p>16:9 aspect ratio is a great all rounder, jack of all trades</p>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">16:9</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">16:10</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">21:9</button>
    <button type="button" class="btn btn-default">Custom</button>


  <h2>Pick a Size</h2>
  Size is a personal preference, and frankly very subjective. But some thought should go into it. 23" - 27" is the most common. Remember! Screen size and pixel
  should be picked deliberately, not haphazardly. You want screen size and resolution to mesh with each other nicely, like ketchup and french fries.
  <p>Most people would agree that a 23" with 4k resolution is not a good match. There's too many pixels on a small screen size, so text would be too small and difficult to read.
  On the other hand, 32" with a 1920 x 1080 pixel would be very pixelated. Text by default will look too big, bulky, and pixelated. Interestly, some people
  are very happy because the bigger text will be easier to read.</p>

  <p>
    The sweet spot for monitor size, though, is 27" at 2560 x 1440.
  </p>

  <h3>Screen Real Estate</h3>
  <p>Note that "screen real estate" refers to the amount of virtual space available for the user to work with,
    more space to have more windows and applications all opened all at the same time, side by side. A 27" monitor
    at 2560 x 1440 will provide more space to work with than a 27" monitor at 1920 x 1080. </p>

    <h1>ADD HERE A TABLE COMPARING TOTAL NUM OF PIXELS WITH VARIOUS SIZES.</h1>

    <h4>For Programmers, Analysts, etc...</h4>
    <p>
    Programmers, analysts, and any user who constantly have text editors and Excel spreadsheets opened will enjoy having more
    "screen real estate.

  <h2>Pick a Panel</h2>

  <div>
    <p></p>

    <h4>IPS (In-Plane Switching)</h4>
    <p>You most likely have an IPS panel right next to you! Check your phone. More often than not,
      it is equipped with an IPS panel. Phone screens need to look great, regardless
      how the consumer hold or view it. IPS panels can be described as "vibrant", "colorful", and/or "lively",
      with great viewing angles, and thus less color shift.
      To better demonstrate viewing angle and why its useful, take your phone screen and
      move its screen in different direction. You'll notice that the colors of the
      picture will change very little. This is a huge advantage of an IPS panel.
    </p>
    <p>Having an IPS panel for monitor can be advantageous. Some people like IPS because
      it allows them to lay down on the ground or exercise on the floor while watching a
      movie . Futhermore, IPS panel's viewing angle also allow two or more people to
      sit next to a screen and watch a movie together, or work on project together: Both people
      will be able to see images and text with the same color and clarity.
      Due to the amazing viewing angles, the colors remain  consistent. Try doing this
      with TN panels, and you'll discover that the pictures will have yellow to it, or look completely washed out.

        <p>Gaming side note: If you like to play games like Skyrim and like to mod add ENB
          to the game, then an IPS panel is your friend. The colors of an IPS will make your
          mods look even better.</p>
        <h4>Panel Conclusion</h4>
        <p>Picking a panel is about compromise and knowing what you'll use the
        monitor for. Gamers will like TN panels for their faster response time.
        But there is nothing stopping a gamer from getting an IPS pannel with 244hz when it
        comes out, but be prepare to cough up $$$ [INSERT LINK TO MONITOR IPS WITH HIGH REFRESH]
        Graphic designers will like VA (for great color production) or IPS for their viewing angles.
        Programmers will like IPS for their ability to look good even in portrait mode.
        But picking a panel without some research can lead to dissapointment.</p>

  <h2>Pick a Resolution</h2>
  <p>Resolution is just one of those things where if you ask 10 people on their
  opinion, you'll probably get 10 different opinions. And here's why: Resolution
  deals greatly with personal preferences and special use case for the monitor.
  First, lets talk about preferences:
 </p>
 <p>People have preferences. Some prefer really sharp, crispier, but smaller text
 the screen, while others prefer bulkier, bigger text. So to find the best resolution for <em>you</em>,
  first discover what you need to use the monitor for.</p>

  And keep in mind this one thing: When you ask a person for advice on helping you
  pick a resolution that's best for you, and that person has only ever experienced 1920 x 1080,
  then they're going to be biased for that resolution.

  <p>Consider the following when picking a resolution:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Eyesight - If you have good eyesight, you can go for higher resolution
      because text will be smaller. </span></li>
    <li><span>Operating system (OS) - OS handles text scaling differently. MAC OS does not
      seem to have issues with high DPI as previous version of windows. </span></li>
      <li><span>Distance from monitor - Approx. 20 inches away from a monitor screen is a good distance,
      but if you sit closer or farther from a monitor, then picka resolution accordingly. Sitting far away
      while using a 23" 3840 x 2160 is asking for major eystrain.</span></li>
    <li><span>Primary use - </span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Note: Different groups of people will answer monitor related resolution questions differently.
    If you ask gamers if you should buy a 27" 2560 x 1440 or a 32" 2560 x 1440, then
    you'll probalby get a different response if you had a programmer or writer on their choices.
    For former won't care to much about resolution, but rather more about refresh rates. But the latter
    will care more because they are reading text all day. But if you ask me (programmer and gamer who has eyesight a sprinkle
    above average), then I'll
    tell you that 27" 2560 x 1440 if great for text <em>and</em> gaming, but 32" 2560 x 1440 is great gaming
    but not for text because there's not enough pixel on a screen size that's too already too big.
  </p>


  <p>Note: Remember that there will be outliers. You'll occasionally run across people who
  will say: "I sit 30 inches away from my 23" 3840 x 2160 monitor, and I can see everything just fine!"
  Listen to your own research and follow the general patterns of the average person, not outliers. These people
just have amazing hawk like eye sight, or a special setup for their monitors. </p>



  <p>To sum up, if you spend most of your time on the monitor reading text</p>

  <button type="button">1920 x 1080</button>
  <button type="button">2560 x 1440</button>
  <button type="button">3840 x 2160</button>

  <h2>Pick Finish</h2>
  <p>Screen Finish</p>

  <p>There is a misconception that people have about IPS panels being "glossy", or "too shiny".
  This is WRONG and likely comes from the fact that phones and tablet (which typically have IPS panels)
  are by nature very glossy, shiny, and reflective. The panel type has nothing do with
  how reflective or non-reflective a screen looks. Rather, it's just a matter of the type of coating a
  manufacturer decides to put onto the monitor.
  </p>

  <p>A monitor being matte or glossy is a matter of personal preference (and in some cases, color reproduction). Back in the 1990s,
    companies sold matte screens to put over monitors to give the user some privacy and make the monitors less shiny.
    Nowadays, monitor technology is so good that even matte screen look amazing compared to their glossy counterpart. Some people

  must have a matte monitor at all cost, while some just don't care at all. </p>

  <p>For those who care, this section is perfect for you.</p>

  <p>Matte monitor advantages:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Less annoyance due to less reflection</span></li>
    <li><span>Less eyestrain (subjectively)</span></li>
    <li><span>Untainted picture quality because outside objects aren't reflected into monitor</span></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Matte monitor disadvantages:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Inability see people's reflection sneaking behind you</span></li>
  </ul>

  <h4>How to Tell if Monitor's Screen is Glossy or Matte</h4>
  <p>Typically, the product specifications will use the following keywords:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Anti-glare</span></li>
    <li><span>Anti-glare coating</span></li>
    <li><span>Matte finish, matte screen</span></li>
  </ul>
  <p>If you are unable to find this information, consider looking at the monitor's manuals, which
  you can typically find by typing "[monitor model name] manual" into Google.
  Dell.com has an amazing search engine for their monitors. If you still cannot find the information, consider going to Reddit's many
  subreddits, such as /r/monitors, /r/pcmasterrace, /r/ultrawidemasterrace and asking there. Just make sure to do some research and mention that you've
tried looking for specs and manuals but couldn't find it. You'll increase your chances of getting help if you
make some sort of attempt to research first.</p>

  <h2>Pick Eye Care Tech</h2>
  <p>Do you suffer from migrane, headache, or eyestrain while using your computer?
  If so, then getting a monitor with flicker free technology can reduce, or eliminate
  the problems.</p>
  <p>Consider getting a monitor with some sort of eye care technology.
    Typically, each company has their own unique name for this technology, but its function remain the same.
  The following are typical names:</p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Acer - Flicker-less</span></li>
    <li><span>Asus - Eye care</span></li>
    <li><span>LG - Flicker safe</span></li>
    <li><span>BenQ - ZeroFlicker or Flicker-free</span></li>

  <h2>Pick Mounting Option and VESA Support</h2>
  <p>
  If you do not have plans on mounting your monitor on an extendable monitor arm,
  and prefer to use the default stand that comes with the monitor,
  feel free to skip VESA mounts.
  If you're using default monitor stand, look to see if the built-in stand has the following options:
  </p>
  <ul class="primary-content-ul">
    <li><span>Height adjust - For ergonomic reasons, you want to be able to adjust the monitor up and down.</span></li>
    <li><span>Pivot and tilt - A quality stand should offer these</span></li>
    <li><span>Landscape and portrait mode - Some people prefer the freedom to orient their monitor in
    a landscape or portrait position (for more vertical space).</span></li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Vesa Mounting</h4>
  <p>If you're unsure whether you want to use the stand or Vesa mount in the future,
  then spend the extra money now to make sure you have Vesa mounting option, should you
  ever decide you want it. You'll find yourself in a predicament should you want to
  use Vesa mount in the future and your monitor lacks it. However, there adapters
  to use for monitors without Vesa mount holes, but a monitor with built in Vesa mount holes will
  give you less headaches.

<h2>Pick X-Sync Technology: G-sync or Freesync</h2>
<h4>Lets talk about $$$ upfront</h4>
<p> These two techs will add more cost to a monitor, with G-sync typically
   costing more ($100 - $200) than AMD's Freesync. If you have a budget, get Freesync. Note: If you want to utilize
 a monitor with Freesync, you need a AMD GPU. Similarily, if you want to utilize a monitor with G-sync, you'll need
an Nvidia GPU. </p>
<p>Nvidia's G-sync and AMD's Freesync is another debate and discussion that could takes hours or days,
and the differences and similarities between these two tech will takes pages of write-up. So to keep it simple,
just keep in mind that G-sync and Freesync will give gamers a "smooth, buttery feeling. Some would consider
G-sync and Freesync to be a luxury, while others consider these two technology a must have. But for all intents
and purposes, for the average consumer, G-sync and Freesync will be a luxury item because it adds
to the price of the monitor.
 </p>
 <p>It is important to note that if a user has never experienced G-sync for Freesync, then
 the user will not miss out on anything. But the moment a user has experienced using these two techs
to play games, it is very difficult to play games without these techs. Going back is very difficult.</p>
<p>Remember: The choice that you make whether to go G-sync or Freesync is permanent for
the lifespan of your monitor. You will be effecitvely "locking" yourself into a company
by buying a technology. let me elaborate: If you buy a monitor with Nvidia's G-sync, then all future GPU purchases
you make should be Nvidia, if you decide you still want to use G-sync. It's a little wasteful
to have a monitor that supports G-sync sitting there, not being used to its full potential. Of course, you could
always sell the monitor, or just use the monitor without using G-sync. Just something to consider.
something to consider. </p>

  <h2>Warranty and Customer Service</h2>
  <p>Warning: What I'm about to say next is very opinionated, but I hope that you'll consider it while making a purchase decision:
    When buying monitor, consider both the seller and the manufacturer's reputation and customer service.
    Customer service is one of those things that one doesn't really need, until one <em>really</em> needs it. Most monitor purchased are usually defect free, with the exception
    of cases where the consumer will get monitors with ghosting, dead pixels, stuck pixels, ghosting, etc... Because of this, it's important to consider how pain-free or pain-ful
    a company's RMA (return) process is.     It's not a good feeling to be on the receiving end of bad luck with a poor quality monitor and have to deal with terrible customer service.
    You'll end up talking to the bad seller, who will advise you to contact the manfucturer, who has a headache inducing customer service department who will
    make you ride a roller coaster to get your monitor fixed. At this point, you'll wish that you had spent the extra dollars and purchased from a reputable seller and manufacturer. Also,
  consider each company's reputation and the number of warranty years they offer for their products. Typically, warranty varies from 1 year - 3 years. </p>

  <h2>Pick a Refresh Rate</h2>
  <p>I'm going to keep it simple with refresh rates: Get a monitor with the highest refresh
  rate that you can afford AND that your GPU can handle. Typically monitors with high
  refresh rates will cost more. </p>
  <p>The average mainstream monitor comes with refresh rate of 60hz, so you'll get your
  standard 60fps gameplay. This is enough for most people, and it will give a very good
gaming experience. If you decide to go for monitors with much higher refresh rates,
make sure to do more research and look at benchmarks to be sure that your current GPU
can actually utlize high refresh rates. </p>
  <p>So what happens if you decide to get a monitor with a high refresh rate but your GPU
  cannot put out enough frames per second? Lets say you get a monitor with 144hz, but
  your GPU can only push out 60fps on a game because it's not powerful enough? Well, nothing bad happens, but you just won't be able
  to utulize all that high refresh rate goodness. You can always upgrade your GPU later on.</p>
  <p>One thing to keep in mind is that if a user has never expeienced higher refresh rates,
  they won't miss anything. Life goes on as normal. But if a user has been playing on a 144hz monitor,
and they have to go back to a 60hz monitor, they will feel the pain because game play will not feel
buttery smooth anymore. It's the same situation with x-sync technology: If you've never used it,
don't worry, you're not missing out. But if you use it, you cannot go back.</p>

  <h2>Other Considerations</h2>
  <h4>Ports</h4>
  <p>There are a few things to consider before finalizing your purchase:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make sure your GPU has the correct ports that the monitor needs. Display port,
    HMDI, DVI, etc...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Make sure that your grphi</p>
  <h3>Pick misc features</h3>
  <p>Finally, when doing shopping, you'll see that certain monitors come with "extra"
    features, such as Blue light filter and speakers. These features should not make or
  break your buying decision. If you want blue light filter, get flux. If you want good sound,
  get dedicated speakers. </p>
  <p>Somep people prefer built in speakers in a monitor, and that's absolutely fine! Although the sound quality
  won't be amazing, built-in speakers sound pretty decent and are great for people who don't need to blast bass
  at 1000% and who prefer a clean desk without bulky speaker and subwoofer setups.</p>
